# Neural Network Framework

## Description

The aim of this project is to create a simple ML (Machine Learning) Neural Network framework, as a C++ library.

The purpose for creating this framework is to help learn C++ and CMake, as well as reinforce understanding of neural networks.

It is important to understand there are many ML libraries already available for C++ - there is nothing novel about this framework. 

In addition, there are external mathematical & linear algebra libraries that would make the development of this framework easier, however creating the functionality for neural networks from scratch will help develop understanding.

External libraries will be used for other things, such as logging and testing.

## Installation

Currently, the best way to use this framework is to download the source code from this GitHub repository, add it to your project locally, and compile it with your executable.

## Usage

TBC...

## Future Development

Further development could include:
* Building upon the framework to allow for creation of more advanced networks, such as:
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* Adding ability to read a wider variety of input data.
* Building functionality in framework for other ML models, such as:
  * Naive-Bayes
  * Linear/Logistic Regression
  * K-Means Clustering
  * K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
  * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
